Data visualization in Python is commonly done using libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly. Here's an overview of how you can use these tools for creating visualizations:
1. <b>Matplotlib<b>
Matplotlib is the foundational library for most data visualization tasks.
Line Plot
A line plot is a type of chart that displays information as a series of data points connected by straight line segments. It is often used to visualize trends over time or a continuous variable.
Bar Chart
A bar chart is used to represent data with rectangular bars, where the length of each bar corresponds to the value it represents.
Histogram
A histogram is used to visualize the distribution of a dataset by dividing it into intervals (bins) and displaying the frequency of data points in each interval.
3. Seaborn
Seaborn builds on Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface with a focus on attractive and informative graphics.
Scatter Plot
A scatter plot visualizes the relationship between two numerical variables as points on a Cartesian coordinate system.
Box Plot
A box plot (also called a whisker plot) is used to visualize the distribution, central tendency, and variability of data. It also highlights outliers.
Heatmap
A heatmap is a graphical representation of data where values are depicted by color. Itâ€™s often used to visualize correlations, matrices, or any data where the intensity of values is important. 
4. Plotly
Plotly is a library for interactive plots.
Interactive Line Plot
Creating an interactive line plot is a great way to visualize data dynamically, allowing users to zoom, hover over points for details, and more. Plotly is a popular library for creating interactive plots. 
Pie Chart
A pie chart is used to represent categorical data as slices of a circle, where each slice corresponds to a category's proportion in the dataset. 
3D Scatter Plot
A 3D scatter plot is a great way to visualize three-dimensional data points. You can create a 3D scatter plot in Python using Matplotlib or Plotly, which allows you to view data in three dimensions.
